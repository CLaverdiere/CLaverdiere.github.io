I'm a software engineer at the Hopkins Applied Physics lab. I studied Computer
Science and Mathematics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I'm
interested primarily in computer graphics and physically based rendering. I'm
also a big supporter of Linux, and free software in general.

You can see some of the things I've worked on [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/).
