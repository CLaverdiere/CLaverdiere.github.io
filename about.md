I'm an undergraduate Computer Science / Mathematics student studying at the
University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I'm interested primarily in computer
graphics, functional programming, and operating systems. I'm also an advocate of
Linux, and free software in general.

These are some of my favorite books:

- Godel, Escher, Bach
- Masters of Doom
- Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World
- Learn You a Haskell for Great Good
- The Code Book
- Fermat's Enigma
- Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!
- The Pragmatic Programmer
